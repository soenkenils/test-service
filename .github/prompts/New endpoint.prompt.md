# New HTTP Endpoint

Your goal is to generate a new HTTP endpoint.

Add the new HTTP endpoint to #file:src/index.ts.

Ask for the following before you start:
- The HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)  
- The endpoint URL
- The request body (if applicable)
- The response body
- The authentication method (if applicable)
- The error handling (if applicable)
- The validation rules (if applicable)

Requirements for the HTTP endpoint:
- The endpoint should be RESTful and follow best practices.
- The endpoint should be secure and handle authentication properly.
- The endpoint should be well-documented with clear descriptions of the request and response bodies.
- The endpoint should handle errors gracefully and return appropriate status codes.
- The endpoint should validate the request body and return appropriate error messages if validation fails.
- The endpoint should be tested and verified to work as expected.
